# Example using tickEventHandler for driving interactions
This is meant to run on the STM32U5G9J-DK2 but can also be viewed in the simulator directly from the designer.

The example shows a keypad and a flashing text stating that the device is 'Armed'.
By entering the correct code (3486) the device can change state to 'Disarmed'.

This was made as a fast exercise for a friend who was running a scouting game. this is not anything but eye-candy.
